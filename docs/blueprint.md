- Primary color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) to evoke a futuristic, technological feel, aligning with the Cyber Blue theme.  Avoid teal.
- Background color: Deep blue (#0818A8) to create a dark, immersive environment reminiscent of cyberspace. Very desaturated, making it subtle.
- Accent color: Magenta (#FF00FF) as a vibrant, contrasting accent to draw attention to key elements and interactions. Analogous to electric blue.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a computerized, techy feel.
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, neutral, and readable body text.
- Use icons from the lucide-react library, ensuring they are consistent and reflect the theme.  For the Cyber Blue theme, the icon colors should primarily be electric blue and magenta.
- Maintain a consistent global layout with a sticky, semi-transparent AppHeader. Utilize ShadCN UI components for a modern and clean interface.
- Implement subtle hover animations for feature cards and use a typewriter effect for the introductory paragraph on the homepage.
